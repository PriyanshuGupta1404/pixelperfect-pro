Project Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

Prerequisites

Node.js (version 14 or higher)

npm or yarn package manager

1. Create a New Vite Project

Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React project with Vite.

npm create vite@latest pixelperfect-pro -- --template react

2. Navigate into the Project Directory

cd pixelperfect-pro

3. Install Project Dependencies

Install the required libraries for the project.

npm install lucide-react file-saver

4. Install Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies, then generate the configuration files.

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

5. Configure Tailwind CSS

Open the tailwind.config.js file and replace its content with the following to enable Tailwind to scan your React components for class names.

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

6. Add Tailwind Directives

Open the src/index.css file, remove all of its existing content, and add the following lines:

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

7. Replace the App Component Code

Open the src/App.jsx file, delete all of its content, and paste in the complete code from the "Main App Component" in your Canvas.

8. Run the Development Server

You are now ready to start the project. Run the following command in your terminal:

npm run dev

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view your application by navigating to the local URL provided in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).
